Small **tag labels** to insert anywhere.

The Bulma tag is a small but versatile element. It's very useful as a way to attach information to a block or other component. Its size makes it also easy to display in numbers, making it appropriate for long lists of items.

But why, if tags are beatiful when colorful, I haven't implemented the availability of colors? Obv, because I haven't time! If you need this feature, we can discuss about it in a dedicated issue and you can became a contributor!

To don't break the Commonmark specification, now I've choose to put the label you want to show inside a tag between two semicolons `:` like this:

| Element | Code | Result | Bulma |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <code>:Tag label:</code> | `<span class="tag">Tag label</span>` | :Tag label: | <span class="tag">Tag label</span> |

Those aren't shields from [shields.io](https://shields.io/), but you can use them using their Markdown notation!
